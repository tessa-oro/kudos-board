### Reflection

* Did the topics discussed in your labs prepare you to complete the assignment? Be specific, which features in your weekly assignment did you feel unprepared to complete?

The content in the lectures as well as the labs were very helpful for completing this assignment. For this project I leveraged the labs less because I felt the lectures were very cohesive, especially with having the ability to refer back to the recordings. There was no section that I felt unprepared to complete.

* If you had more time, what would you have done differently? Would you have added additional features? Changed the way your project responded to a particular event, etc.
  
If I had more time I would have added features such as adding a name to comments. I would also like to add the ability to delete post comments. Additionally, I would allow a user to select the image to use for their board rather than it being random.

* Reflect on your project demo, what went well? Were there things that maybe didn't go as planned? Did you notice something that your peer did that you would like to try next time?

I have not demoed my project upon the time of submission as demos were moved to the following week.

### Shout out

Someone that especially helped me during my project was my peer, Axel. I had a complex bug related to showing the posts belonging to a specific board when clicking view more. He was very helpful in debugging with me and brainstorming different possibilities together for where the issue was coming from. I am appreciative of the time he set aside to review my code with me in the midst of working on his own project.
